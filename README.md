Exploring research done by Justin Salamon and Juan Pablo Bello on https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04363

## Next Steps:
  - Document everything in a gitbook page or notion page (even github.io pages)
  - Try adding additional spectral features and test results
  - Try recommended data augmentation approach (or use newer dataset)
  
## Achieved:
  - Replicated (close enough) baseline results
  - NPY representation of the data as good as using PNG, so will use that for smaller footprint

## Environment

Python 3
