Exploring research done by Justin Salamon and Juan Pablo Bello on https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04363

## Next Steps:
  - Create function to extract the 3 second frames from the spectrogram array (128x128) shape arrays
    - Follow paper instructions. Take as many as possible by shifting one frame at a time
  - Store that data in a manageable format, no need to be an image per se, a json array suffices
  - Start documenting methodology in a notion page

## Environment

Python 3
